# Digital-Image-Organiser-DIGI-
Whenever there is someone's birthday, we search our hard disk for his/her photo with
ourselves. This can be cumbersome if there are lot of photos.
The purpose of this project is to provide user with photos with birthday person, so that he
can wish him/her by posting on social media,etc.
The backend uses a CNN to generate 'Tag' for each image. Using the tag of each image a
central metadata file of tags and location of image is stored.
Whenever user queries, it returns set of images of his/her with birthday person.

How to Run ?

        1. Train the CNN model on your dataset.
        2.Run digi_main.py file and enjoy!
